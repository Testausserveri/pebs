# vibraCAPTCHA

An alternative CAPTCHA solution that uses [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) to validate human users by buzzing a remote vibrator. A project submission for the Stupid Hack 2025 hackathon.

Traditional CAPTCHAs, with their text-based and visual puzzles, are becoming increasingly ineffective. Modern AI models like ChatGPT can now solve them with ease, rendering them useless as a security measure. The fundamental limitation for bots, however, is not a lack of vision or text recognition‚Äîit's the inability to experience physical sensations.

**vibraCAPTCHA** turns this limitation into a security feature. The system prompts the user to connect a Bluetooth-enabled vibrator, which then administers a series of physical "buzzes." The user's response is validated by how they answer questions about the sensations, a task only a human can perform correctly.
